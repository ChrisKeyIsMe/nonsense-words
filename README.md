# nonsense-words
Teach your kids to read phonemically! Create nonsense words of varying lengths.


This SPA is intended to be used for practising the skill of visual blending - a key skill for developing English literacy. 

 ### How to use:
1. Click on the "spin" button
2. Guide your child by first having them identify the *sound* made by the leftmost letter
3. Do the same for the middle letter
4. Have your child combine both sounds - for example, /k/ and /a/ should form /ka/ (pronounced "kah")
5. Finally, have your child identify the *sound* made by the rightmost letter
6. Combine that new sound to the previously-made sound to form the word

**Note: Because the words made are absolutely random, you may sometimes encounter words that are nearly impossible to properly pronounce. This is OK, as it builds a child's confidence with encountering unfamiliar vocabulary and following-through on decoding.**
